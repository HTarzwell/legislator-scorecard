1. What's the most important function of the updated site? If the site causes a visitor to do/know one thing, what is it?
2. Where will it be hosted?
3. What backend data if anything will it have access to?
4. How often does it need to be updated? Will it be updated from CSVs/other data sources?
5.  What's the timeline/urgency of getting something up?
  6. Cosponsor sooner than the scorecard
6. If the wireframes are close to what we need:
  7. How will I get the data
  8. Can someone be responsible for proofreading
9. How should I locate people's state reps/house reps?
10. Is there any money ($7/month) for heroku hosting if we need a backend?
11. Is offering summary data about current legislative activity/visualizations like the map, or focused information based on someone's local reps + potential action items for them, more important? Can we completely dispense with the first?
